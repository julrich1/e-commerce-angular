The sweet caramel touches, however, are still reserved for the Gulden Draak. With addition of extra malt The new recipe, on basis of 3 different kinds of malt added in a volume of 4 times the content in lager, provide the Gulden Draak 9000 Quadruple with a deep golden amber colour and a fruity scent. Together with the smooth and subtle sweet taste ensures this a wonderfully accomplished bouquet. In line with the traditions of Brewery Van Steenberge Just like the other specialty beers of Brewery Van Steenberge is the Gulden Draak 9000 Quadruple a beer of high fermentation with secondary fermentation.
